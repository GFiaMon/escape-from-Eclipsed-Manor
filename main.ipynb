    "# Haunted Mansion Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Description\n",
    "The Haunted Mansion Project is an immersive and interactive experience designed to simulate a haunted mansion. The project incorporates various elements such as storyline development, character design, environment creation, sound design, interactive features, and user experience to create a compelling and spooky adventure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Storyline Development\n",
    "The storyline is crafted to engage the audience with a spooky narrative. The player wakes up in a dark, cold room with no memory of how they got there. The goal is to escape the haunted mansion within a limited time while uncovering its secrets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Character Design\n",
    "Characters, including the player and non-playable characters (NPCs), are designed to enhance the haunted atmosphere. For example, the \"Ghostly Butler\" NPC provides eerie interactions and clues to the player.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Environment Creation\n",
    "The mansion environment is created with various rooms, each with unique descriptions and items. Rooms are connected by doors, some of which are locked and require keys or solving puzzles to unlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Sound Design\n",
    "Creepy sound effects and music are incorporated to heighten the suspense and fear. The `print_slow` function is used to display text slowly, adding to the eerie atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Interactive Elements\n",
    "Interactive features allow users to explore and interact with the haunted mansion. Players can move between rooms, pick up items, unlock doors, and interact with NPCs. The game includes puzzles, such as the Mystery Door that requires a three-digit code to unlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. User Experience\n",
    "The user experience is designed to be seamless and immersive. The game includes a timer, move counter, and various commands to help the player navigate the mansion. The `display_intro` and `display_outro` functions provide a captivating start and end to the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rooms and Items\n",
    "Rooms and items are defined in dictionaries and instantiated as objects. Each room has a description and a list of items. Items can be keys, furniture, or other objects that the player can interact with.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Doors\n",
    "Doors connect rooms and can be locked or unlocked. Some doors require keys to unlock, while others involve solving puzzles. The `Door` class includes properties for the connected rooms, locked status, and key required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Player\n",
    "The player has properties such as the current room, inventory, and move count. The player can move between rooms, pick up items, and interact with doors and NPCs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NPCs\n",
    "NPCs provide interactions and dialogue to enhance the storyline. The `NPC` class includes methods for dialogue trees and potential combat scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Timer and Game Over\n",
    "A timer is implemented to limit the duration of the game. If the player does not escape within the allotted time, the game ends with a \"game over\" message. The `timing` function calculates the remaining time, and the `gameover` function displays the game over message.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Helper Functions\n",
    "Various helper functions are implemented to support the game mechanics, such as `print_slow` for slow text display, `get_help` for displaying available commands, and `handle_mystery_door` for solving the Mystery Door puzzle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "By the end of this project, players will have experienced a fully developed haunted mansion adventure, complete with eerie environments, interactive elements, and a compelling storyline. The Haunted Mansion Project aims to provide an engaging and spooky experience for users."
